# CINELDI_MV_reference_system
Code for processing and analysing a reference data set for a Norwegian medium voltage power distribution system (the CINELDI MV reference system). The reference data set is available with DOI:10.5281/zenodo.7703070. The data set is described in the following data article: I. B. Sperstad, O. B. Fosso, S. H. Jakobsen, A. O. Eggen, J. H. Evenstuen, and G. Kjølle, ‘Reference data set for a Norwegian medium voltage power distribution system’, Data in Brief, 109025, Mar. 2023, doi: 10.1016/j.dib.2023.109025.

## Overview of code: 

The following code files are found in the main branch. (Code on other branches is experimental and less likely to be stable.)

### calc_share_customer_type.py
Code for calculating the share of load per customer type for each load time series in the load data set for the CINELDI MV reference system.

### create_load_mapping.py
Script for creating mapping between the 104 load time series (load IDs) in the load data set and bus IDs of the 124-bus CINELDI MV reference grid.

### create_grid_with_load_snapshot.py
Script for creating a version of the grid data set for a certain operating state, obtained for a "snapshot" for a given day and hour of the year from the load demand time series

### load_profiles.py
Module for handling load profiles, i.e. time series for load demand (typically hourly).

### load_scenarios.py
Module for handling scenarios for the long-term development of load demand in distribution system.

### pandapower_read_csv.py
Module for loading and setting up pandapower network object for the CINELDI reference grid based on input .csv files on the MATPOWER format.

### test_extract_load_time_series.py
Script for extracting load time series in units MWh/h for existing load points in the CINELDI reference grid

### prepare_reldata.py
Script for preparing data for reliability analysis (load point data and component reliability data) 
for the CINELDI MV reference system.

### process_grid_data.py
Script for processing the CINELDI MV reference grid by adding charging susceptance based on standard line type information from Planleggingsbok for kraftnett and estimating line lengths. Also updating format of files to standard MATPOWER format.

### test_analysis_CINELDI_MV_system.py
Test script for simple power flow analyses by applying load development scenarios and 
load time series to the CINELDI MV reference system.
